=why systems work so well=
chapter 3

forester quote starts out this chapter

roughly, if something works well for untold time, don't randomly
discard the parts of that system that you don't understand

properties of highly functional systems
- resilience
- self-organization
- hierarchy

- resilience :: ability to bounce or spring back into shape, position, etc after being pressed or stretched.
  Elasticity. The ability to recover strength, spirits, good humor, or any other aspect quickly

the opposite of rigidity or brittleness
arises from a rich structure of many feedback loops
single loop brings a system back to its  desiredstate
resilience is several such loops using different mechanisms, at different time scales, with redundancy, one kicking in if another one fails

feedback loops that can restore or rebuild feedback loops is meta-resilience

meta-meta is loops that learn, create, design, and evolve more restorative structures

- self-organization :: capacity of a system to make its own structure

==hierarchies==

relationships /within/ each subsystem are denser and stronger than relationships /between/ subsystems

#+begin_quote
original purpose of a hierarchy is always to help its originating
subsystems do their jobs better This is something, unfortunately, that
both the higher and lower levels of a greatly articulated hierarchy
easily can forget.

[...]

If a single corporation bribes the government
to favor that corpora- tion, the advantages of the competitive market
and the good of the whole society are eroded.

- suboptimization :: when a subsystem's goals dominate at the expense of the total system's goals
