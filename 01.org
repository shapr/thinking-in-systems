feedback delays mean symptoms are visible when the problem is severe
A stitch in time saves nine.

if feedback loops reward winners with the means to win more, competition is eliminated
the rich get richer and the poor get poorer

diverse systems are more stable and less vulnerable
don't put all your eggs in one basket

some solutions create further problems, because we have complex systems

- feedback loop :: the basic operating unit of a system

systems thinking is complementary to reductionist thinking

=chapter one=

a system must consist of three things
- elements
- interconnections
- function / purpose

#+begin_quote
Note that information about the existence of a problem may be
necessary but not sufficient to trigger action -- information about
resources, incentives, and consequences is necessary too.

A system's function or purpose is not necessarily spoken, written, or expressed explicitly, except through the operation of the system.

Aha, this is the answer to the Ship Of Theseus question!

- stock :: the foundation of any system.
  A stock is elements of the system that you can see, feel, count, or measure at any given time.
  A system stock is just what it sounds like: a store, a quantity, an
  accumulation of material or information that has built up over time.
  A stock is the memory of the history of changing flows within the system.

stocks are shown as boxes and T is a faucet on either end that can be turned up or down.

the 'clouds' stand for wherever the flows come from and go to, sources
and sinks that are being ignored for the present discussion.

bathtub example

#+begin_quote
A stock can be increased by decreasing its outflow rate as well as by increasing its inflow rate
#+end_quote
like vaccines decrease the outflow of infectious material and thus decrease pandemics!
and isolation, and masks, and ... I'm beginning to see the many flows here.

workforce flows, hiring is in, and rates of quitting and firing is out, but each has different costs

national wealth can boosted by building up a stock of factories and
machines, OR more cheaply, by decreasing the rate at which factories
and machines wear out, break down, or are discarded!

I like this already!

back to the bathtub, you can change the flows abruptly, but the
*stock*, water in the tub, is difficult to change quickly.
