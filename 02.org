- thermostat
- temperature of a heated room,
  compared to a leaky bucket where a higher water level increases the pressure of the leak's outflow

  yeah ok
  the stock goes on changing while you're trying to control it
  if restocking a store, you must account for the sales that happen while ordering new stock and delivery lag
- feedback loop info can only affect future behavior
  there will always be a lag between

Many economic models make a mistake in this matter by assuming that
consumption or produc- tion can respond immediately, say, to a change
in price.

Oh yeah, like tariffs
begin two loop systems?

A stock with one reinforcing loop and one balancing loop
- population
- industrial economy

2007 population had roughly 21 births per 1000, and 9 deaths per thousand
if that continues, world population doubles in 60 years

a world disease (covid?) could increase the mortality rate to 30 deaths per thousand
if fertility remained 21 per thousand, the population would gradually decrease
- shifting dominance :: where one loop overtakes another in changing the flow of a stock?
yup, complex behaviors occur when feedback loops shift dominance

Dynamic systems studies usually are not designed to /predict/ what will happen,
but instead to explore /what would happen/ if driving factors unfold in a range of different ways
#+end_quote

this sounds like Hamming's "consider what might happen" statement

Questions for testing the value of a model
1. are the driving factors likel to unfold this way?
2. if they did, would the system react this way?
3. what is driving the driving factors?

- [ ] How do I build models and check them against historical information?
  actually, I don't even know how to build models! I want working code!

I might nominate our next reading group book to be [[https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/prep/][Practical Doomsday]]
that book could mix well with systems thinking?

#+begin_quote
the greater the fraction of output a society invests, the faster capital stock will grow
#+end_quote

world capital's flow: reinforcing loop vs balancing depreciation loop
depends on
- investment fraction - how much output the society invests rather than consumes
  (what if we train them and they leave? What if you don't and they stay?)
  (How does this apply to LLMs?)
- efficiency of capital - how much capital it takes to produce a given amount of output
  (how much does worker training pay off)
  (how much does LLM training improve the output?)
- average capital lifetime
  (how long is a trained worker useful?)
  (I suspect this is LLMs biggest weakness, they're changing the world away from the one they were trained for)
