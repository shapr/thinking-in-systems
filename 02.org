==one stock systems==
- thermostat
- temperature of a heated room,
  compared to a leaky bucket where a higher water level increases the pressure of the leak's outflow
  ðŸ¤”
  yeah ok
  the stock goes on changing while you're trying to control it
  if restocking a store, you must account for the sales that happen while ordering new stock and delivery lag
- feedback loop info can only affect future behavior
  there will always be a lag between

Many economic models make a mistake in this matter by assuming that
consumption or produc- tion can respond immediately, say, to a change
in price.
#+end_quote
Oh yeah, like tariffs
begin two loop systems?

A stock with one reinforcing loop and one balancing loop
- population
- industrial economy

2007 population had roughly 21 births per 1000, and 9 deaths per thousand
if that continues, world population doubles in 60 years

a world disease (covid?) could increase the mortality rate to 30 deaths per thousand
if fertility remained 21 per thousand, the population would gradually decrease
- shifting dominance :: where one loop overtakes another in changing the flow of a stock?
yup, complex behaviors occur when feedback loops shift dominance

Dynamic systems studies usually are not designed to /predict/ what will happen,
but instead to explore /what would happen/ if driving factors unfold in a range of different ways
#+end_quote

this sounds like Hamming's "consider what might happen" statement

Questions for testing the value of a model
1. are the driving factors likel to unfold this way?
2. if they did, would the system react this way?
3. what is driving the driving factors?

- [ ] How do I build models and check them against historical information?
  actually, I don't even know how to build models! I want working code!

I might nominate our next reading group book to be [[https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/prep/][Practical Doomsday]]
that book could mix well with systems thinking?

page 49 says
#+begin_quote
the greater the fraction of output a society invests, the faster capital stock will grow
#+end_quote

world capital's flow: reinforcing loop vs balancing depreciation loop
depends on
- investment fraction - how much output the society invests rather than consumes
  (what if we train them and they leave? What if you don't and they stay?)
  (How does this apply to LLMs?)
- efficiency of capital - how much capital it takes to produce a given amount of output
  (how much does worker training pay off)
  (how much does LLM training improve the output?)
- average capital lifetime
  (how long is a trained worker useful?)
  (I suspect this is LLMs biggest weakness, they're changing the world away from the one they were trained for)

economic flows and population flows have similar feedback loop structures

==system with delays - biz inventory==
I want some math in here, is there an equivalent publication with working models?

says it's a version of the thermostat system

This feels like a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation][recurrence relation]] too.
That makes sense, since each element of a RR is a "function of the preceding values"

I bet I can use ~fix~ to build a simple model
How would I model delays? Maybe it's "apply this change N steps later" ?
inventory ordering depletes money immediately, but the products arrive later, how to do both?

For extra bonus fun, how to compose models?

Is this a finite response filter from Hamming?

Oh ha, Hamming's shower delay is on page 54 !

#+begin_quote
In physical, exponentially growing systems, there must be at least one
reinforcing loop driving the growth /and/ at least one balancing loop
constraining the growth, because no physical system can grow forever
in a finite environment.
#+end_quote

A pollution constraint can be renewable or non-renewable.
- renewable :: environment has a finite, usually variable, capacity for remove
- non-renewable :: environment has no capacity to absorb the pollutant or make it harmless

renewable or not changes how growth is likely to end

figure 37

initial underground deposit has enough for 200 years at starting rate
but exponential increases mean it peaks at 40 years

the higher and faster you grow, the farther and faster you fall
when building up capital stock depending on a non-renewable resource

what if price isn't constant?

In summary, GET YOUR SOLAR PANELS NOW, they'll only get better!

==renewable stock constrained by renewable stock - fishing==
living renewable resources such as fish,grass,trees can regen themselves with a reinforcing feedback loop

rabbits can make many more rabbits quickly

but if you eat up rabbits until the existing population of rabbits can't find each other
no more baby rabbits
*SYSTEMS CAN COLLAPSE*

adding a sonar to the fishing fleet lets you find those last few fish, and then fisherman are in serious trouble
possible behaviors of this renewable resource system
- overshoot and adjustment to sustainable equilibrium
- overshoot beyond equilibrium followed by oscillation around it
- overshoot followed by collapse of the resource and the industry dependent on the resource
The outcome depends on two things
1. critical threshhold beyond which the resource population's ability to regen itself is damaged
2. rapidity and effectiveness of balancing feedback loop that slows capital growth as the resource becomes depleted

fast and effective feedback brings the system into equilibrium smoothly
slow and ineffective means resource and industry both collapse

I'm gonna bet that GPUs are currently in overshoot.
