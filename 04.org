=why systems surprise us=

1. Everything we think we know is a model. Models will never be the /real/ world
2. Our models usually have a strong congruence with the world.
3. Our models fall far short of representing the world fully.

You can't navigate well in an interconnected, feedback-dominated world unless you take your eyes off short-term events and look for long-term behavior and structure

events are not structure

==Linear Minds in a Nonlinear World==

- linear relationship :: can be drawn on a graph with a straight line
- nonlinear relationship :: cause does not produce a proportional effect, must be drawn with curves or wiggles

nonlinearities /change the relative strengths of feedback loops/ and
can flip a system from one mode of behavior to another

==layers of limits==

- law of the minimum :: doesn't matter how much nitogren is available to the grain, if it's short on phosphorus
  so, systems have a limiting factor?

- limiting factor :: At any given time, the input that is most important to a system is the one that is most limiting

*growth itself depletes or enhances limits* and thus changes what is limiting

==ubiquitous delays==

guess the actual delay and then multiply by three

Can I apply fourier analysis to discover feedback loops?
principal component analysis? will that show me dependent cycles?

oceans take decades to respond to warmer temperatures, we don't know what affect we will have

==bounded rationality==

Adam Smith's invisible hand quote.

- bounded rationality :: people make reasonable decisions based on the information they have
  but they don't have perfect information about distant parts of the system.

Shae's thought: Kickstarter and friends are ways of getting better/more information into the system.
but there are still missing flows

Stanford prison experiment is scary stuff, doubt I could read that book again.

She says that putting new actors in a dysfunctional system won't help, but instead

#+begin_quote
What makes a difference is redesigning the system to improve the
information, incentives, disincentives, goals, stresses, and
constraints that have an effect on specific actors.

Heck yeah!

I'd paraphrase that as, tax incentives to boost local manufacturing will pay off better than tariffs used to punish non-local manufacturing.
