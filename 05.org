* System Traps and Opportunities

- archetypes :: common patterns of problematic systems
  examples are addiction, drift to low performance, and escalation

Donella Meadows calls these "system traps" because standard responses will not fix these structural problems.

population feedback loops are described, with heavy handed strategies that went badly, or instead incentives to make all children both desired and well supported that went extremely well.

** tragedy of the commons

cattle grazing on shared land benefits the cattle owner, but the cost is shared by all
overgrazing grass means it is less likely to regenerate itself, and perhaps may die off entirely due to erosion

The tragedy of the commons arises from /missing feedback/ or /too long delayed feedback/ from the resource to the growth of the users of that resource.

#+begin_quote
Surely, you'd think, no group of people would be so shortsighted as to destroy their commons.
#+end_quote
OH BOY, LET'S TALK ABOUT CORPORATE FUNDING OF OPEN SOURCE!

three ways to avoid the tragedy of the commons
- educate and exhort - help ppl see the consequences of unrestrained use of the commons, appeal to their morality
- privatize the commons - divide it up so each person reaps the
  consequences of their own actions. if some lack the self control to
  stay below carrying capacity, they only harm themselves
- regulate the commons - "mutual coercion, mutually agreed upon"
  regulation must be enforced by policing and penalties

#+begin_quote
For regulation to work, the regulators must have the expertise to
monitor and interpret correctly the condition of the commons,
effective means of deterrence, and must have the good of the whole
community at heart. (They cannot be uninformed or weak or corrupt.)
#+end_quote

- A busy intersection uses regulation to improve flow over an unregulated free-for-all.
- parking spaces with meters are privatization.
- money in a bank is protected, preventing you from treating a bank as a commons.
  in return, your own money in the bank is protected
- the FCC limits radio broadcasting, otherwise there would be a chaos of overlapping signals
- many city garbage systems charge by amount of waste, changing a commons into pay-as-you-go
** drift to low performance

#+begin_quote
Some systems not only resist policy and stay in a normal bad state, they keep getting worse. One name for this archetype is "drift to low performance".
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
/The actor tends to believe bad news more than good news./

[...]

The actor thinks things are worse than they really are.

[...]

/the desired state of the system is influenced by the perceived state/ Standards aren't absolute. When perceived performance slips, the goal is allowed to slip.
#+end_quote

I'm a bit lost, but I think this is "if at first you don't succeed, redefine success" that is, accept whatever you achieved as success?

#+begin_quote
The lower the perceived system state, the lower the desired state.
The lower the desired state, the less discrepancy, and the less corrective action is taken.
The less corrective action, the lower the system state.
#+end_quote

Oh, I see. As Trump does bad things, those things are not challenged and overturned, so they become the new normal?

Or roughly, my standards are what I will tolerate?

Two antidotes:
- keep standards absolute, regardless of performance
- make goals sensitive to the /best/ performances of the past, instead of the worst

Oh this is great!

** escalation
two sides fighting, each escalate themselves.
can be great when researching a cure for AIDS, terrible when two countries are fighting
examples include political campaigners smearing each other.

escalating even in a good direction can be a problem, hard to stop

two possible cures mentioned are unilateral disarmament, or negotiated disarmament
** success to the successful
competitive exclusion (rich get richer?)

antitrust laws are the only solution?

/diversifying/

A species can learn or evolve to exploit new resources.

#+begin_quote
Diversification is not guaranteed, especially if the monopolizing form
(or species) has the power to crush all offshoots, or buy them up, or
deprive them of the resources they need to stay alive. Diversification
doesn't work as a strategy for the poor.

ðŸ”¥ This connects to the last book we read, where Hamming said small companies have the advantage of reduced administration overhead due to easier communication, etc.
These days the popular road to lifelong success is to create a valuable company and then sell it off to a big company.
I guess that's slightly better than having zero change?

#+begin_quote
create feedback loops that keep any competitor from taking over
entirely.  That's what antitrust laws do in theory and sometimes in
practice.  (One of resources very big companies can win by winning,
however, is the power to weaken the administration of antitrust laws.
#+end_quote

ðŸ”¥ Oh, like, Trump's FCC allowing [[https://www.commondreams.org/news/fcc-approves-paramount-skydance-merger][two companies to merge]] to serve more than 39% of the TV market?

#+begin_quote
most obvious way out of success-to-the-successful is by periodically "levelling the playing field".
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
Native american "potlatch" where those who have the most give away many of their possessions to those who have the least
#+end_quote

- unbeatably tax the rich at higher rates than the poor
- charity
- public welface
- labor unions
- universal and equal health care and education
- taxation on inheritance

#+begin_quote
These equalizing mechanisms may derive from simple morality, or they
make come from the practical understanding that losers, if they are
unable to get out of the game of success to the successful, and if
they have no hope of winning, could get frustrated enough to destroy
the playing field.
#+end_quote

A short search engine query implies that wealth is only redistributed when the [[https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/top-wealth-shares-long-run-history-ca-1300-today][playing field is destroyed]].
I'd be thrilled and surprised to see significant counterexamples.

** shifting the burd to the intervenor -- addiction

Can this be summarized as "choosing short term improvements that lead to increasing problems in the long term" ?

Attempting to prevent an unwanted system rebalancing? Pretending change isn't necessary and trying damaging shortcuts to attempt to continue a broken system?

"burden-shifting systems"

- modern medicine has shifted the responsibility for health away from healthy lifestyle and onto intervening doctors and medicine
  Huh, hadn't thought much about this. Removing healthcare for US citizens is one way to change that feedback loop?
