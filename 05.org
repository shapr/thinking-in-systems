=System Traps and Opportunities=

- archetypes :: common patterns of problematic systems
  examples are addiction, drift to low performance, and escalation

Donella Meadows calls these "system traps" because standard responses will not fix these structural problems.

population feedback loops are described, with heavy handed strategies that went badly, or instead incentives to make all children both desired and well supported that went extremely well.

==tragedy of the commons==

cattle grazing on shared land benefits the cattle owner, but the cost is shared by all
overgrazing grass means it is less likely to regenerate itself, and perhaps may die off entirely due to erosion

The tragedy of the commons arises from /missing feedback/ or /too long delayed feedback/ from the resource to the growth of the users of that resource.

Surely, you'd think, no group of people would be so shortsighted as to destroy their commons.
#+end_quote
OH BOY, LET'S TALK ABOUT CORPORATE FUNDING OF OPEN SOURCE!


three ways to avoid the tragedy of the commons
- educate and exhort - help ppl see the consequences of unrestrained use of the commons, appeal to their morality
- privatize the commons - divide it up so each person reaps the
  consequences of their own actions. if some lack the self control to
  stay below carrying capacity, they only harm themselves
- regulate the commons - "mutual coercion, mutually agreed upon"
  regulation must be enforced by policing and penalties

#+begin_quote
For regulation to work, the regulators must have the expertise to
monitor and interpret correctly the condition of the commons,
effective means of deterrence, and must have the good of the whole
community at heart. (They cannot be uninformed or weak or corrupt.)

- A busy intersection uses regulation to improve flow over an unregulated free-for-all.
- parking spaces with meters are privatization.
- money in a bank is protected, preventing you from treating a bank as a commons.
  in return, your own money in the bank is protected
- the FCC limits radio broadcasting, otherwise there would be a chaos of overlapping signals
- many city garbage systems charge by amount of waste, changing a commons into pay-as-you-go

==drift to low performance==

#+begin_quote
Some systems not only resist policy and stay in a normal bad state, they keep getting worse. One name for this archetype is "drift to low performance".
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
/The actor tends to believe bad news more than good news./

[...]

The actor thinks things are worse than they really are.

[...]

/the desired state of the system is influenced by the perceived state/ Standards aren't absolute. When perceived performance slips, the goal is allowed to slip.
#+end_quote

I'm a bit lost, but I think this is "if at first you don't succeed, redefine success" that is, accept whatever you achieved as success?

#+begin_quote
The lower the perceived system state, the lower the desired state.
The lower the desired state, the less discrepancy, and the less corrective action is taken.
The less corrective action, the lower the system state.
#+end_quote

Oh, I see. As Trump does bad things, those things are not challenged and overturned, so they become the new normal?

Or roughly, my standards are what I will tolerate?

Two antidotes:
- keep standards absolute, regardless of performance
- make goals sensitive to the /best/ performances of the past, instead of the worst

Oh this is great!
